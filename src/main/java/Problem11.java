Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all

strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
 */

// Take an array of list of strings.
// use string methods and write a function which extracts the chracters of strings in the list based on the number of characters of given input.
//Once it got the list then display that list.

    public static void main(String args[]){
        //String[] names = new String[7];
        String[] names = {"sai","sunny","sony","abhishek","abhista","anil","balraj","vijaya"};
             System.out.println(names);
    }
}
